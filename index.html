        Hello World!
    </h1>

    <h1 class="name">
        My name is Amelia Freeman!
    </h1>

    <p id="introOne">
        I find lots of topics interesting. My favorite sports are 
        baseball, football, and soccer. I love to read and watch TV. 
        I also love learning about history. Recently, I returned to 
        the USA after living in Germany for a year and a half. I live 
        in Kansas City, MO.
    </p>

    <p id="introTwo">
        My interest in coding started when I told a software development 
        course during my undergraduate degree program in 2012. I was 
        interested in coding, but loved my major, History, too much, 
        so I did not choose to pursue coding at that time. Later, when 
        living in Germany in 2022, I once again had the goal to pursue 
        software development, but again it did not work out. I am very 
        excited to finally get the chance to pursue this.
