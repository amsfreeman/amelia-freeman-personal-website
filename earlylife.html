        Early Life
    </h2>  
    <p>
        I was born in Kansas City, MO on March 22, 1993. I lived in 
        Kansas City, MO until my family moved when I was nine. I 
        attended Catholic grade school and high school.

        I graduated from St. James Academy, a Catholic high school in 
        Lenexa, KS, at the age of 18 in 2011. Following high school, 
        I attend the University of Arkansas to pursue a history 
        degree.
