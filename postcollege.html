        Post College Years
    </h2>  
    <p>
        In May of 2015, I graduated from the University of 
        Arkansas with my history degree. I worked for a period 
        of time at a company in Kansas City, and then was an 
        Au-Pair in Munich, Germany for the whole year of 2017.
    <p>
        After returning from Munich, I worked as a Recruiter at 
        UnitedLex for three years. Following this period, I moved 
        back to Germany and lived there from May 2021-December 2022.

        I returned to the US in December 2022, and since then 
        have been working to learn software development by 
        coding using CodeCademy.com. During this time period, I 
        also spoke to a variety of people regarding how to bet 
        get into a career in software development. Ultimately, 
        I chose to enroll in Flatiron's Software Engineering Bootcamp. 
        I am excited for this new adventure.
