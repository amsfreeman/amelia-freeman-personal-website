        College Years
    </h2>  
    <p>
        In August 2011, I started my studies at the University of 
        Arkansas. I pursued a degree in History, was a part of 
        Alpha Delta Pi Sorority, a historian society, and did 
        various servious activities.

        During my junior year (2013-2014), I studied abroad at 
        Oxford University in England. While there, I continued 
        my history studies, met new friends, and joined various 
        history groups.
